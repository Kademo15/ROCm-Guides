# This is a WIP. Please ignore for now.

# Prerequisites:
1. A spare USB stick with at least 12GB, but 16GB or more is best. This will make a USB which you can drop `.iso` files onto and boot them easily.
2. Be running on Windows 10 (or know how to reinterpret this guide to work for your OS).
3. Somewhere you can install Ubuntu. You'll probably want at least 100-200GB at a *minimum* if you plan on using multiple AI tools. Especially if you want space for lots of models. I'd recommend adding as much space as you can.
4. 7-Zip

## Step 1:
Find the latest release of Ventoy, and download the zip which has `-windows.zip` at the end.

https://github.com/ventoy/Ventoy/releases

## Step 2:
Unzip the zip file you just downloaded.

## Step 3:
Go into the the ventoy-**version number** folder.

Run `Ventoy2Disk.exe`

## Step 4:
Select your USB device. Note: This will destory what is on your USB device, so backup anything thats on it.

# Step 5:
Click Install. This will turn your USB device into a `.iso` loader and booter.

# Step 6:
After you've verified that its finished installing you may have to unplug and plug in the USB device.

# Step 7:
There may be 2 new drives in Windows Explorer. If that's the case, one probably won't work. Ignore that and go into the one that works.

# Step 8:
